Program works when tested with the tester that was given for the 
assignment.
For the sum of all the numbers. I imported them in counts of 4 so 
it was easier to divide by a thousand and use the remained to calculate
the hundreds and as follows for the tens and the one unit. 
To get the error code to give the code for the first test that failed
I implemented another if loop within the first one so that only if it 
wasn't a valid would the could change if also the error code was 0. If it 
wasn't then it would remain the first number the test failed on. 

There are no known issues in my code and I ran it with the numbers that 
were given in the assignment and some that I made up.
